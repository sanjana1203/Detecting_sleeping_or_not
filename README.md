# Sleeping Detection Using Computer Vision

This project implements a **computer vision–based sleeping detection system**.  
The model analyzes facial and visual cues to determine whether a person is **sleeping or not sleeping**, enabling real-time monitoring applications.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** Classification  
- **Domain:** Computer Vision / Human Behavior Analysis  
- **Framework:** Python (OpenCV, MediaPipe, Deep Learning)  
- **Execution Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

The project applies vision-based learning techniques to classify sleep states effectively.

## Model Details

- Uses **computer vision and machine learning techniques**
- Analyzes eye status and facial landmarks
- Processes live camera frames or images
- Outputs **Sleeping / Not Sleeping prediction**

## Workflow

**Video/Image Input → Face Detection → Feature Extraction → Model Inference → Sleep State Prediction**

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Applications
